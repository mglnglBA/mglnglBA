Ey, it's @mglnglBA and say ğŸ‘‹.

Iâ€™m interested ğŸ‘€ in privacy, internet carbon, internet measurements, online advertising, data analysis and machine learning; and currently learning about computer networking and data science while doing a PhD at uc3m collaborating with IBiDat (UC3M-Santander Big Data Institute).

Let's play this game of life and anything to share with me you are free to reach me at mibermej@pa.uc3m.es ğŸ“«.
